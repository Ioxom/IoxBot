# IoxBot
A simple discord bot that has no advanced functions yet. This will probably never become public as no one would understand all our jank functions that don't actually moderate or anything.

# Commands
-belt | Abuse your friends!

-BotInfo | Information about the bot. Includes author, GitHub, commands, creation_date and version.

-uno_reverse_card | Pull a no u on the haters.

-are_they_groovin? | Are they?

And a couple prefixless commands, no u, E, rip, hello IoxBot and IoxBot. It's up to you to find out what they return.
